Initial steps - most are one-time
---------------------------------

- A PostgreSQL database server must be running.
  On a Linux system, you would do one of:

  * login to the system as the database user 'postgres' (you usually do
    'su - postgres' as 'root' to log in to that account) and run:

	pg_ctl start

  * login as 'root' and run:

	systemctl start postgresqlXX (XX being the version)

  * login as 'root' and run:

	service postgresql start

- A web (HTTP) server with PHP support (like the Apache HTTP Server with
  mod_php installed) must be running.
  On a Linux system, you would do one of (as 'root'):

  * login as 'root' and run:

	systemctl start httpd-prefork

  * login as 'root' and run:

	service httpd start

- Create the database user to host the application's database.
  On PostgreSQL, login to the system as the database user 'postgres' and run:

	createuser -P trinventum

  It's advised for the user to be the owner of the database that will
   be created.
  It's easiest to create a user with the same name as the system user name
   and create the database as the system user.
  You can create other database users later, and give them full or less
   privileges so that those users can execute all the activities or just
   the ones they have access to.

- Create the application's database.
  On PostgreSQL, login to the system as the database user 'postgres' and run:

	createdb -O trinventum trinventum

- A procedural language suitable for the database must be installed in the
  logical database.
  On PostgreSQL versions earlier than 9.0, login to the system as the
  database user 'postgres' and run:

	createlang plpgsql trinventum

  (don't worry if it says that the language already exists).
  Later PostgreSQL have the language already built-in by default.

- Database access rules must be created within the database server unless you
  wish to leave the default rules.
  Login to the system as the database user 'postgres' or 'root' and run:

	cp /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf-backup
	echo local trinventum trinventum scram-sha-256 >> /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf
	echo host all all 127.0.0.1/32 scram-sha-256 >> /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf

  (Note the double ">>" - it's CRUCIAL to use double ">>", a single ">" would
  OVERWRITE the target file).

  On older PostgreSQL versions replace 'scram-sha-256' with 'md5'.

  If you'll need to access the database from another computer:

  * a line similar to the 'host all all 127.0.0.1/32 scram-sha-256' should
    be added to pg_hba.conf, containing the correct IP address,
  * firewall rules may need to be adjusted
  * the '/etc/hosts.allow' file (tcpwrappers) may need to be adjusted

- After changing the access rules for the database server, restart it.
  On Linux, you would do one of:

  * login to the system as the database user 'postgres' and run:

	pg_ctl reload

  * login as 'root' and run:

	systemctl restart postgresqlXX (XX being the version)

  * login as 'root' and run:

	service postgresql restart

Application installation
------------------------

To install:

- copy the contents of the 'webapp' directory (including hidden files) to a
  chosen location reachable by the web server and adjust the access modes
  accordingly so that the web server can actually run the files.

  Alternatively, if you have the 'make' program and some common Linux
  utilities, you can run 'make install', passing the prefix of the target
  directory. Trinventum will be installed in "$(PREFIX)/trinventum". Examples:

	make install PREFIX=/srv/www/html
	make install PREFIX=/var/www/html
	make install PREFIX=$HOME/public_html

  To install the documentation, you can add a chosen directory as the DOCDIR
  parameter to 'make install'. Documentation will be installed in
  "$(DOCDIR)/trinventum". Examples:

	make install PREFIX=/srv/www/html DOCDIR=/usr/share/doc
	make install PREFIX=/var/www/html DOCDIR=/usr/share/doc
	make install PREFIX=$HOME/public_html DOCDIR=$HOME/tools/doc

- the necessary database structures will be created by the application
  itself upon the first successful login as a user WITH FULL ACCESS TO THE
  DATABASE SCHEMA (like the schema owner 'trinventum' created earlier).
  There is no need to run any SQL scripts manually.

Each upgrade also requires that a user WITH FULL ACCESS TO THE DATABASE SCHEMA
 logs in to the application before others.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Uninstallation
--------------

To uninstall, if needed:

- remove the contents of the 'webapp' directory from the location chosen
  during installation (you can also run 'make uninstall', passing the same
  prefix as during the installation),

- delete the application's database - run as 'postgres':

	dropdb trinventum

- delete the application's database user - run as 'postgres':

	dropuser trinventum
