Trinventum e-commerce business manager installation instructions.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

To install:

- create the database user to host the application's database,
  e.g. run as 'postgres' (you usually do 'su - postgres' as 'root' to login
  to that account):

	createuser -P trinventum

- create the application's database, e.g. run as 'postgres':

	createdb -O trinventum trinventum

- copy the contents of the 'webapp' directory (including hidden files) to a
  chosen location reachable by the web server.
  Alternatively, if you have the 'make' program and some common Unix/Linux
  utilities, you can run 'make install', passing the prefix of the target
  directory. Trinventum will be installed in "$(PREFIX)/trinventum". Examples:

	make install PREFIX=/srv/www/html
	make install PREFIX=/var/www/html
	make install PREFIX=$HOME/public_html

- the necessary database structures will be created by the application
  itself upon the first successful login. There is no need to run any
  SQL scripts manually.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

To uninstall, if needed:

- remove the contents of the 'webapp' directory from the location chosen
  during installation,

- delete the application's database - run as 'postgres':

	dropdb trinventum

- delete the application's database user - run as 'postgres':

	dropuser trinventum
